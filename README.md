**NFT-driven dungeon crawler where loot drops are minted as tradable NFTs**

---

## 🧙 Project Description

**LootLegends** is a revolutionary blockchain-based dungeon crawler that transforms traditional loot mechanics into a decentralized NFT economy. Players explore dangerous dungeons, battling monsters and discovering rare loot—each item is minted as a unique, tradable NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.

Each loot drop has distinct attributes such as:
- **Rarity**
- **Item Type**
- **Combat Stats** (Power, Defense, Magic)

The game features a dynamic rarity system where higher-level dungeons offer greater chances of acquiring legendary items. Players can trade items through the built-in marketplace or combine multiple NFTs to forge upgraded loot.

## 🚀 Project Vision

We aim to create the **first truly decentralized RPG economy**, enabling full ownership of in-game assets. LootLegends bridges traditional gaming with Web3 by ensuring players can monetize their gameplay through NFT ownership and trading.

In the long term, we envision a **metaverse-ready** platform where LootLegends items can be used across multiple virtual worlds and games.
